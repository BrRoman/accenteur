# Accenteur

Accenteur is a web application written in Javascript to accentuate latin texts according to the liturgical rules in force in the Roman Catholic Church.

Its algorithms and data were adaptated from [Collatinus](https://github.com/biblissima/collatinus).

Its name comes from the french name of a little bird: the Dunnock (*Prunella modularis*).
